/*
 * The protocol side of a realtime voice call, with no ESP-IDF or FreeRTOS in
 * it so the host tests compile it as is (tests/test_muse_voice_call.py).
 * muse_voice_call.cpp moves bytes between it, the session's streams and the
 * voice task.
 *
 * The wire, over the Muse session's HTTP-over-Noise connection:
 *   POST /voice/realtime?call_id=ID, body left open (NDJSON both ways):
 *     up:   one hatch.voice.call.start admission record, then
 *           input_audio_buffer.append lines: 40 ms (960 samples) of 24 kHz
 *           mono PCM16LE each, base64, paced to real time;
 *     down: server events, one per line. Audio arrives as
 *           continuous_audio_video.delta audio_delta.audio_frames (or the
 *           older response.output_audio.delta delta), 24 kHz PCM16LE base64.
 *   POST /voice/end-call {call_id, call_started_at, call_ended_at, thread_id?}
 *     on every way out of a call while the connection is up: closing the
 *     media alone doesn't end the call. Server policy may also end a call
 *     before the client's own limits.

/* ---- Push-to-talk reply gate ----
 *
 * After a press, the reply that was playing must never come back, and only
 * replies to speech from a later hold may play. Reply audio is identified by
 * the provider's response_id on each continuous_audio_video.delta (not the
 * response.created id, which the server mints itself and reissues when
 * trailing audio of a closed response arrives). PCM carries no link to the
 * caller's input item, so attribution is by order, and conservative:
 *
 *  - A press marks every response_id seen so far stale, for the rest of the
 *    call, and leaves no item current.
 *  - Speech starting on an input item makes it the current item (only the
 *    latest), unconfirmed, and marks stale whatever was playing or waiting
 *    (the server's own barge-in).
 *  - Until hatch.voice.turn_started names the current item, a new id waits
 *    (HOLD: the caller buffers it, bounded) so the reply's first words
 *    aren't lost. That turn_started confirms the item: what waits plays, and
 *    new ids after it play too, without a turn_started of its own (a turn can
 *    have several provider responses: tool continuations, companion replies;
 *    not all of them get an alias turn_started).
 *  - One id plays (or waits) at a time: a newer one takes over, the older
 *    goes stale, and what's queued of it is flushed (FLUSH), so two replies
 *    never interleave. Once the current reply's response.done has come, its
 *    ids play what still arrives until a new id plays; then they stop
 *    without a flush, so what they queued plays first.
 *  - A turn_started naming an older item, one from before the last press,
 *    once the current item's reply has played and finished (its
 *    response.created came, its audio played and its response.done
 *    followed, and nothing waits) makes that item
 *    current and confirmed: older work reporting back (a delegated task's
 *    result, the outcome of a spoken approval) plays. The finished reply's
 *    ids keep playing what still arrives but never take over or flush, and
 *    a continuation that played without a turn of its own is that older
 *    work's. A turn_started naming the latest hold's item again (its own
 *    continuation) makes it current again; the adopted reply stops, after
 *    what it queued. A press that heard no speech
 *    still lets nothing play, and an earlier item of the same hold is never
 *    adopted. A reply cut off by a press never comes back, but the work it
 *    started may report back this way: that is the point, since answering
 *    an approval question with a press is how the user says yes. Audio
 *    carries no link to its item, so a continuation of the latest hold's
 *    reply that arrives without its own turn_started after older work was
 *    adopted counts as that work's (a filler line, then a tool call, then the
 *    real answer as a continuation), and audio of the finished reply that
 *    arrives after the adopted reply starts is cut. turn_settled can't mark
 *    the end instead: it waits for that older work's reply too.
 *  - Otherwise, a turn_started naming any other item (a late reply to older
 *    work) marks stale what waits and what plays without a turn of its own (a
 *    continuation whose audio came before its alias turn: it was that older
 *    work's), flushing it, and blocks new ids, which go stale, until a
 *    turn_started names the current item again. input_suppressed for the
 *    current item leaves none.
 *  - Audio without a response_id, and any new id with no current item, is
 *    dropped. A press that heard no speech so plays nothing until a later one
 *    does; there's no timer.
 *  - Every id is remembered for the whole call. Past MUSE_VC_GATE_IDS
 *    distinct ids the gate can't tell old from new any more: it drops
 *    everything new and says so (muse_vc_reply_gate_full), and the caller
 *    ends the call.
 *
 * Late output of older work that carries no turn_started, arriving while
 * the current item is confirmed, can't be told from a continuation, and
 * plays.
 *
 * The current reply is also tied to the latest turn that named the current
 * item: its submission_message_id, and the response.created id that
 * followed, so muse_vc_reply_gate_done can tell its own completion from an
 * older one's. */
